## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories
  - #### First Time Visitor Goals
  
    a. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to ask questions without having further instructions.
  
    b. As a first time visitor, I want to be able to see if my question has already been answered.
    
  - #### Returning Visitor Goals
  
    a. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to see if the question I asked, has been answered.
    
  - #### Frequent User Goals
  
    a. As a frequent user, I want to be able to browse the questions asked by others.
    
* Design Considerations
  - Colour Scheme
  
  The colour scheme is the standard bootstrap colour scheme.

  The messages tell the user the current player's turn and also the result of the game. These will be yellow text on a black background to differentiate them from the buttons
  
  - Typography
    
    For simplicity, only one font style will be used. The Poppins font is a clear sans-serif font which works well for all elements of the site. The fallback sans-serif is specified in case the Poppins font fails to load.
    
  - Imagery
  
    There are no images used in the site. It is simply a set form elements to submit and retrieve data from the database
    
  - Wireframes

## Design Strategy

### The strategy plane:
**What are you aiming to achieve in the first place and for whom?**

*** Users
The site is designed to allow visitors to the site to ask questions of the site owner.

Users should be able to use the site without having further instruction.

The interface should be simple and work on a variety of devices.

Submitted questions should be visible to users with a default answer ("Awaiting answer") until they are answered by the admin.

Submitted questions should be assigned to a pending question category until they are answered.

***Admin
Once answered, questions should be assigned to an appropriate category to help users to find the answer to their question.

The admin should be able to create and edit categories.

The admin should be able to assign questions to categories.

Each question should be able to belobg to more than one category.

### The scope plane:
**Which features, based on information from the strategy plane, do you want to include in your design?**

**Must Have**

Users must be able to submit questions.

Questions and answers must be displayed on the page.

Admins must be able to answer a question and assign it to one or more categories.

Admins must be able to add and edit categories.

**Could Have**

When a new question is submitted, it could automatically be assigned to a "Pending" category

When a new question is submitted, it could send an email notification to an admin

**Future plans**

A future version could allow users to upvote answers to affect their position in the list
When an

**Usability**
Users are assumed to be accessing the site on a mobile device so the site should adopt a mobile first design.

Users should be able to navigate the site without instructions, so navigation should be intuitive.

For the initial build, this site will incorporate:
* The basic pages.
* A form to submit a new question.
* An Accordion section will contain the category headings allowing quick access to each category's answers.
* An Admin area to answer questions
* An admin area to add and edit categories.

**Future Development:**
* An voting system to allow users to upvote answers.

### The structure plane:
**How is the information structured and how is it logically grouped?**

The information should be grouped by;

* The main user page will contain the question form along with the Accordion section with answer categories. 

### The skeleton plane:
**How will our information be represented, and how will the user navigate to the information and the features?**

The main user page will contain a menu which allows the admin to login and access admin pages

A message will be displayed to tell the user their question has been submitted.

### The surface plane:
**What will the finished product look like? What colors, typography, and design elements will we use?**

Wireframes for the game display and instructions modals are below:

![The User Page](# "The User Page")

![Admin Pages](# "Admin Pages")

The pages will use the default Bootstrap colours for all elements.

Messages will be yellow on a black background.
